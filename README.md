## 👨‍💻 About Me
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samidukushalaya/samidukushalaya/main/assets/pictrue1.gif" width="200" align="right" />



I'm a  **Data Engineer** who is passionate about learning how to work with data.  
I enjoy exploring how data moves through systems and how to build pipelines to make data useful.  

Right now, I'm focused on learning tools like **Python**, **SQL**, and **Apache Spark**,  
and understanding how data is stored, transformed, and used in real-world applications.






## 🚀 What I Do

- ✅ Design and build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines  
- ✅ Work with tools like Apache Spark, Airflow, and dbt  
- ✅ Manage data lakes and warehouses (e.g., AWS S3, Snowflake, BigQuery)  
- ✅ Write efficient SQL and Python for data processing
